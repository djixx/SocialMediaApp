# SocialMediaApp
FUNCTIONALITIES:
Registration and Login: Users can register with their information and log into their accounts using their credentials.
User Profiles: Each user has their own profile where they can display personal information such as name, profile picture, and other details.
Posting Textual Content: Users can create and share their text posts with the community.
Administrative Privileges: The administrator has the ability to manage user accounts and content, including the ability to create and delete users and their posts.
Security: The application ensures the security and privacy of user data, as well as appropriate authorization and authentication for both roles.
TECHNOLOGIES:
Frontend: Angular is used to create an interactive user interface, allowing users to view profiles, posts, and utilize the applicationâ€™s functionalities.
Backend: Spring Boot is chosen for building the backend part of the application. It enables the definition of RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and the database.
Database: PostgreSQL is used to store user data, posts, and other relevant information.
Security: Technologies such as JSON Web Token (JWT) and Spring Security ensure secure user authentication and authorization.
Maintenance: The application is maintained using various tools for testing, bug tracking, and updating.

CONCLUSION: This project is characterized by executing all processes on a single local machine. All servers run on localhost, allowing access to the application from the same device. This application is designed to provide deeper insight into the characteristics and differences between the functionalities of two distinct user roles: regular users and administrators.
By analyzing the functionalities available to these two roles, users can access different parts of the application according to their permissions. While users can view and edit their profiles, share posts, and interact with content, administrators have extended capabilities. Administrators can perform all activities available to regular users, but they also have the authority to manage users and content, including creating and deleting user accounts and posts.
Through the technologies used in this project, we gain insight into the fundamentals of operating more complex applications and systems. Although this project operates on a smaller scale, the principles behind implementing user roles, component communication, and data security apply to much more complex applications and systems. Therefore, this project provides a foundation for understanding how more complex technological solutions function and are architected on a much broader level.
