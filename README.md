# SocialMediaApp

## Functionalities

- **Registration and Login**: Users can register with their information and log into their accounts using their credentials.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has their own profile where they can display personal information such as name, profile picture, and other details.
- **Posting Textual Content**: Users can create and share their text posts with the community.
- **Administrative Privileges**: The administrator can manage user accounts and content, including creating and deleting users and their posts.
- **Security**: The application ensures the security and privacy of user data, along with appropriate authorization and authentication for both user roles.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Angular is used to create an interactive user interface, allowing users to view profiles, posts, and utilize the applicationâ€™s functionalities.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot is chosen for building the backend. It enables the definition of RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and the database.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used to store user data, posts, and other relevant information.
- **Security**: Technologies such as JSON Web Token (JWT) and Spring Security ensure secure user authentication and authorization.

## Conclusion 

While users can view and edit their profiles, share posts, and interact with content, administrators have extended capabilities. Administrators can not only perform all the activities that users can but also have the authority to manage users and content, including creating and deleting user accounts and posts. This project gives us a solid base to build on in the future, ensuring that the platform continues to meet the needs of its users.
